# Simple Payroll System

Welcome to the **Simple Payroll System** repository! This project is developed as part of the **Information Systems** course and provides a web-based solution for managing employee payroll and daily attendance. Built using **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, **CSS**, **HTML**, and **MySQL**, this system allows you to manage employee records, track attendance, calculate payroll, and generate reports.

## Project Overview

This system includes several key modules for employee management, attendance tracking, payroll calculation, and reporting. Below is an overview of the core modules:

### Modules

1. **Daily Attendance**
   - Employees can clock in and out by entering their employee ID, capturing their time in and time out.
   - The system also allows searching for attendance records based on employee ID and date.
   - This module is essential for tracking employee work hours and ensuring accurate payroll calculation.

2. **Add New Payroll Record**
   - Add new payroll records for employees.
   - Payroll records include salary calculations based on hours worked, deductions, and earnings.
   - This module ensures that each employeeâ€™s earnings are properly calculated and stored.

3. **Manage Employee Basic Info**
   - Manage the essential details of each employee, such as name, employee ID, job title, and contact information.
   - This helps maintain an up-to-date database of employees for payroll and attendance tracking purposes.

4. **Manage Employee Earnings and Deductions**
   - Configure and update employee earnings (such as basic salary, overtime, etc.) and deductions (such as tax, insurance, etc.).
   - This module allows adjustments and updates to employee pay details, ensuring accurate payroll processing.

5. **View Reports**
   - Generate detailed reports on employee attendance, salary, and payroll.
   - Generate employee-wise reports, including attendance summaries and salary breakdowns.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language to handle backend logic and process payroll calculations.
- **MySQL**: Database management system to store employee information, attendance records, and payroll data.
- **JavaScript & jQuery**: Used for dynamic interactions, such as real-time searching of employee data and updating records without page reload.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the front-end user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for creating a responsive and modern layout.
